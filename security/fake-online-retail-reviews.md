# Fake Online Retail Reviews 
 
There have been a massive influx in fake online retail reviews, especially on Amazon (this information is coming direct from the Amazon Fraud Team), and there have also been a huge about of fraudulent products hitting the market on Amazon. 

I was asked today by Arie if I could provide some tips on how to spot fake reviews, fake products, or suspicious activity on Amazon. 

Here are some tips and tricks to make you a better shopper, and to help protect you and your family from fraud while shopping online (I use amazon as an example as I trained with their fraud team on this, and they were kind enough to provide me some of the info, but this applies across any and all ecommerce sites that have review systems)

### Advice 

1. Check out many of the free review analyzers out there. The best one is www.fakespot.com - Just copy the URL link to the product your looking at, and paste it into their free machine learning review search bar. It will analyze the listing, seller, and reviewers, then produce a score for you - and it is totally free + you do not need an account or need to give them any information at all.  

   Best way to identify fraudulent reviews (these are what the Amazon fraud team looks for):

1.    Most important - The total number of reviews. Across Amazon, normally, it takes the following total orders to receive 1 legitimate review:

* Electronics = >90 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review (so the guy was correct with electronics but not all products)
* Clothing = >50 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Shoes = >50 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Computers = >100 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Supplements = >50 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Watches = >50 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Items less than $10 = >1,000 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Sunglasses = >100 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Designer Items like Rolex and anything Katie would buy =  > $1,000) = 500 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review (this is because the people that have the money to drop large dollar amounts on expensive items usually do not care enough to spend the time to go through and review the order statistically
* Bikes = >25 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Food = >1,500 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Baby Items = >10 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review (moms are nuts and will review everything)
* Supplements (or anything that you put inside your body) = >25 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review
* Skincare = >50 legitimate orders to get 1 legitimate review

How to think about this ^.  Expensive items will not sell in large quantities or in large volumes quickly. Cheap items will sell in huge volumes quickly.  

If a $2,500 USD watch has 2,500 reviews, and those reviews were all made in 2021, you can say with 100% certainty that it is fake or the reviews are fake - so proceed with caution.  Based on the numbers above, you should ask yourself, “Does the total number of reviews match the item? 

```
Example: I just found a product on amazon where the seller is adding fake reviews either themselves, or by paying for bots/click-farms to do them.
Product: Random-Name “Designer” Sun Glasses that were zebra colored and a design only a very small amount of people would like
Price: $250 USD + $10 Shipping
Review: 4.9 Starts
Total Reviews: 10,528
Total 5 Star Reviews: 10,304How many legitimate people would need to purchase these sunglasses to get 10,500 reviews?
Lets do the math based on the numbers above: 10,500 reviews X 100 (legit orders-based on the above breakdown) = 1,050,000 (this means that in order to get this many real reviews, over 1 million people would have to buy these sunglasses - I would bet my career that 1 million people are not walking around with these sunglasses when even Nike Shoes do not have this many sales on Amazon)
```

2. The total timeframe the reviews were added. Look at the date the reviews were added. There should be an even spread across each month and year since the item was posted. For example if the item posted in January 2018, and it has 100 reviews in 2018, 150 reviews in 2019, 160 reviews in 2020, and 80 reviews so far in 2021, this would be considered high probability of being authentic. If the item was posted in January 2019, and had 150 reviews in 2019, and 4500 reviews in 2020, 34 in 2021, you know the reviews in 2020 were likely bots or click farms.
3. Up-Votes: Most legitimate reviews will get around 5 legit up-votes. If a review has greater than 20 upvotes, be suspicious
4. Add more weight to verified orders - but do not think they are legit because they are verified as that just means someone purchased the item (the seller can purchase and review their own item of course and so can click-farms)
5. Takeovers - This is a HUGE problem. A takeover is when-  lets say I sell a watch that sells for $100, and I sell 100,000 of them. My page for this watch gets around 800 reviews over 2 years. BUT, I then close my amazon store or stop selling this item.  Arie, who is going to start selling women’s shoes, starts looking for pages that are no longer active or pages that no longer have active sellers (products not available). He sees my page with 800 reviews, and takes over the page by saying he is now the seller of this item. Once he claims the page as the new seller, he can then change any info he wants, including pics, and information. He then uploads his new product information, adds the women’s shows pictures, and now, he has 800 5star reviews for what looks like his shoes. However, when you do some digging, you will start realizing that the reviews are for a different product. If you ever see this, do NOT purchase the product, as you can consider it an account takeover.
6. Look at the accounts that are leaving the reviews. Click the name on the review. If that person has 500 reviews, and they are all 5 star, you can assume this is a bot or click-farm fake account. If you find 1 single click-farm account on the reviews of the amazon product, you know that the seller on of this product paid a company to give fake reviews, and their are likely many more, as bots and click-farms do not leave 5 start reviews out of the kindness of their hearts for free. This does not mean it is fake or a bad product, but it is something to keep in mind when making a purchase decision based on reviews alone.
7. Language - People that leave really positive/negative and valid reviews will tend to have excitement or anger in their writing tone, and will have realistic results. For example, “This product is amazing!!!!!  I am really happy I found a it and my skin is already looking little better in 3 months!” This is more likely to be real than: “This product is amazing.  My skin looks 25 years younger after 1 bottle. Highly recommend.” This does not always hold true, but it is a datapoint to consider. Also, if the review does not talk about the negatives of the product, and the person leaves a 3 paragraph review with 100% positive language, then you can assume that is a paid review and not real.  A real in-depth review will use both positive and negative language. When sellers pay for reviews, they pay for positivity, not negativity.  Example “I really love this product, even though the smell was not great, but the results were worth it!”
8. Negative Up-Voting: If a product has an overall 4.5 star review, but the first review you see is negative 1 star review with 50+ upvotes, you can assume with 100% certainty that this is likely their competitor upvoting 1 negative review to try and discourage you from buying the product (with the hopes you will go to their page and buy their knock-off or same product)
9. If the reviews have links or try to sell a different product, assume this is a competitors review and is not valid. For example: “I hate this product. It made my skin break out into a rash. Luckily, I still have my Product A from Manufacturer B on hand, otherwise I probably would have had to go to the dermatologist.”10. Negative reviews: ALL products, no matter how amazing you think they are, will have both positive AND negative reviews. You should see some negative reviews into the overall reviews. However, it is VERY important that you read those negative reviews as a lot of times the negative reviews are actually negative because they are complaining about the shipping, or the package getting stolen from their door, not the product itself. For example, here is a 1 Star Review I just found: “I would never buy this shampoo again! It took over 6 weeks for UPS to get it to me and when it got here it was left out in the sun for hours. Do not buy!”11. IGNORE the Amazon Prime or Shipped By Amazon Logo:  Just because an item is shipped by Amazon or is under the Amazon Prime deal, means literally nothing. If I want to sell on Amazon, and I want my products to be warehoused and shipped by Amazon, all that I need to do is contact Amazon, let them know that I want my product to be warehoused and shipped by them and they will have me ship a large amount of my product direct to their facility, and charge me a fee to do so. There is NO REVIEW or VETTING or product checks that happen. The only thing that happens is robots (I kid you not) will take the item and place them somewhere in a pre-selected section in the 1,000,000 square feet warehouse. Do NOT think that a product that is shipped by amazon or a prime product means it is authentic, not a knock off, or has not been fraudulently up-voted/does not have fake reviews.  It is the equivalent to me having a UPS store ship my product. Just because the UPS store is the one that puts it in a box to ships it, does not mean it is a UPS backed product.Note: I would however pay attention to reviews with Photographs, as these tend to be more authentic as Bots will very rarely upload photos (needs more sophisticated programing) for every review and click-farms charge a major premium to do so, which most sellers will not pay for.

12. You do NOT have to verify yourself or your product to sell on Amazon. For example, I could be an authorized seller of Nike Shoes on Amazon. When someone buys the shoes I sell that say Nike, I of course can ship them a pair of knock-off Nike shoes and no one would know, especially Amazon. Here is a fun fact for you. If you have purchased Nike shoes on Amazon over the last year or two, there is a 96% chance that they were fake knock-offs. Nike does NOT sell their shoes on Amazon, does NOT allow it, and the entire “Official” nike shoes page is fake/was created by a private party. If a manufacture sells their items on Amazon, the seller will be, in this case, Nike. Nike does NOT allow their shoes to be sold on Amazon due to the fact that they had a major problem with knock-offs, so they cut ties with amazon back in 2019. 99 out of 100 pairs of Nike shoes on amazon today are not real or are cheap knock-offs. Here is an example of already verified Fake Nikes that the Amazon fraud team is about to shut down (the page looks real right? - Run this link through www.fakespot.com and it gives it an F rating):  https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Women-Pegasus-Turbo-Running/dp/B07VGY4PWB/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=nike%2Bshoes&qid=1622323051&sr=8-8&th=1&psc=1
What is happening here is the sellers will go to Alibaba and buy knock-off Nikes for around $20 per pair, and sell them as real. 90% of the customers will not know they are fake. There are indicators but you would really have to know Nike to see it. The reason this is a problem is the materials will sometimes include toxic chemicals, be cheaply made, will break down quickly, and can even cause foot and knee problems due to not having the correct arch support measurementsHere is an article about Nike no longer selling on Amazon if you don’t believe me :slightly_smiling_face: : https://www.businessinsider.com/nike-stops-selling-amazon-2019-1113. Look at who it is sold by! Look at the area right below the In-Stock section. The seller is key. If it is a Ralph Lauren Watch, but the seller is ShangzueBejing1 - And you see they are a manufacturer in CN, you know with almost 100% certainty that it is a fake product being knocked off by a manufacturer in CN.The best advice when looking at Amazon reviews: Look at the total star reviews. If they are positive, for example, a 4.8 Star review, then IGNORE the positive reviews, and ONLY look for the negative reviews. The positive 4.8 star is all you need to read on the positive side. You do not need to read a bunch of reviews of people trying to convince you to buy the product. Focus on the negative reviews, as those will almost always be genuine, legitimate, and authentic (as long as they are about the actual product and not the seller or shipping). Also, ignore any negative PRODUCT reviews about the seller. Most products will have 10+ sellers, so a negative review in the product section about a seller or shipping in the product review section should pull zero weight. HOWEVER, the seller reviews in the seller section on the other hand should be considered, as a seller with a 60% review should be purchased from with caution. If there are a large number of negative reviews saying the product is fake, a knock-off, or that the product is not as advertised, you should be careful and consider buying a different product or buying it direct from the products site.Final comments: Here are the top 5 categories as on yesterday with the most fake products and the most fake reviews according to Amazons fraud manager (I asked her)

Nike confirms that it is no longer selling its products on Amazon

1.      Jewelry (Be VERY carful buying anything silver in color as there is a high number of silver looking cheap jewelry that is made with Cadmium which is an extremely toxic)
2.      Consumer Electronics

3.      Personal Care Products

4.      Children’s Toys

5.      Purses/Handbags (Especially Exspensive or Designer  -  1 in 3 are usually knock-offs in todays market) - Side hint - if you like Louis Vuitton bags. The LV logo will NEVER be cut off on a stitch and the LV art on the bag will also never be cut off or half way showing on a real bag. Picture one (a) is real, picture 2 (b) is fake. Look at the logo getting cut off. This is an easy trick on this designer (almost ALL designers use this trick to show the quality of their manufacturing)

1.      https://us.louisvuitton.com/eng-us/products/rendez-vous-monogram-metal-nvprod2750004v#M45767 (Look at the LV logos - none are cut off or halfway showing)

2.      https://legitcheck.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Real-Vs-Fake-Louis-Vuitton-Shoulder-Bag-LV-min.jpg (this is a confirmed fake - LV logos are cut off and stitched over on the edges)

I hope that helps one of you!
